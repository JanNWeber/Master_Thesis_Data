# Master_Thesis_Data
This repository contains all pythonscripts and exceldatasheets I used during my master thesis "Classification of weather patterns for the Greater Horn of Africa using cluster analysis" to calculate, postprocess and display the data.
The comments in the codes are in German.
There are no datasets stored in this GitLab repository, the used ERA5 datasets are too big for that. The self-calculated datasets (usually called Folder_1.csv in the python files) are copied out of the available Excel files, this can be repeated with little effort.
